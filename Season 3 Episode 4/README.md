# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Ensemble Learning

## Executive Summary

This project presents a credit card fraud detection system built for a highly imbalanced dataset derived from European cardholder transactions in September 2013. The simulated data includes 503,936 transactions, of which only 961 (0.19%) are fraudulent. To tackle this challenge, the approach integrates an ensemble of XGBoost, LightGBM, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), resulting in an ROC AUC score of 0.82. This evaluation metric was chosen to emphasize the accurate ranking of rare fraud cases over legitimate onesâ€”an essential consideration given the significant class imbalance.

## Data

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains 31 features, including 28 anonymized variables (V1-V28) derived from PCA transformations, along with 'Time', 'Amount', and 'Class' (indicating fraud). The data is highly imbalanced, with only 0.19% of transactions labeled as fraudulent.

## Methodology

The project employs an ensemble learning approach, combining the strengths of three models:
1. **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework that is efficient and effective for classification tasks.
2. **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, known for its speed and efficiency.
3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A type of neural network that can capture complex patterns in the data.

The ensemble is trained on the training set and evaluated on a separate test set. The models are combined using a voting classifier to improve prediction accuracy.

## Results

The ensemble model achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.82, indicating a strong ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model's performance was validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

## Conclusion

The credit card fraud detection system demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in handling highly imbalanced datasets. The combination of XGBoost, LightGBM, and MLP provides a robust solution for identifying fraudulent transactions, achieving a commendable ROC AUC score of 0.82. Future work may explore further enhancements, such as additional feature engineering, to improve model performance.
