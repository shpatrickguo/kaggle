The Kaggle Playground series is a collection of interactive machine learning tutorials in which participants are invited to build models on a provided dataset.

## [Playground S4E6](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e6)

Predict the categorical academic risk assessment for each student using data from the [Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success).

## [Playground S4E3](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e3)

Predict the probability of various defects on steel plate. The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Steel Plates Faults dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/198/steel+plates+faults) from UCI.

## [Playground S3E5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e5)

Predict the quality of wine using the given data. The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Wine Quality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset).

## [Playground S3E4](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e4)

Predict the probability for the target Class for each id in the test set using synthetic data from the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
